# Password-Checker
The program checks whether a string entered by the user meets several criteria to qualify as a valid password. Passwords must be at least 8 characters long, and they must use at least 3 of the following 4 types of characters: upper case letters (e.g., A, B, C, ...) lower case letter (e.g., a, b, c, ...) digits (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...) special characters (e.g., !, @, $, %, ...).
